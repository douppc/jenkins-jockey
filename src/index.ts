/**

 * @remarks
 *
 * The Jenkins Jockey extension provides the API documented here, which can be accessed by other extensions
 * within Visual Studio Code.
 *
 * This API can be accessed from the Visual Studio Code API as follows:
 * ```ts
 * import {extensions} from 'vscode';
 *
 *
 * const jenkinsJockey = extensions.getExtension('doupp.jenkins-jockey');
 * jenkinsJockey.exports.commands.connectServer();
 * ```
 *
 * There are several {@link commands} that can be called as well as some API clases.
